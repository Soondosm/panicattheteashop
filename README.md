experimenting with UE4 in only C++ (wherever possible). At the time of writing, 
I've created a basic sphere planetary body that pulls a player-controlled pawn into it.
Pawn moves with WASD keys, and spacebar key triggers a fire particle effect.

TO-DOS:
-Create multiple scenes
-Add more planetary bodies character can jump between
-Add Dialogue
-Create complex interactable objects
-Update graphics and sound
-add multiplayer functionality
